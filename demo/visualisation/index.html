                        House price is a great concern for UK people for a long time. BBC news reported that house prices are still increasing in UK reigions even if the speed of growth is slowing down except the south east of the UK where prices are rising fastest [1]. Median house price, as the market value of property in that area, can aviod to be skewed due to outliers, which is the reason why average house price is not adopted. For example, a property might be sold for a price far higher or lower than typical for the area [2]. Therefore, a research need to be investigated that the trend of median house price in the England and Wales and to explore whether local people can afford local house prices and find the related influence factors to predict the future tendency of house price and people's affordability.

							<li>Since 1997, the median prices paid for residential properties in England and Wales have been increasing continuously.</li>
							<li>Also, the location distribution, as a geographical factor, influence property price.  Firstly, the regions in England and wales can be divided into 2 parts, one is named the south part including East of England, London, South East and South West parts, and the remaining regions can be named north part. Thus, there is a significant difference in median house price between south part and north part in England and Wales, which can be seen clearly from the map that properties in south part and have higher house prices than north part.</li>
							<li>Secondly, the difference in property price between London and outlondon is significant. London has the most highest house price than other regions in England and Wales every year.</li>

                            <li>The gap between median house price and median gross annual income widens over time in England and Wales. Though the income is rising as increasing of house price, the house prices increasing is pretty faster than earnings. And this trend is played out across England and Wales, it is most stark in London. It can be seen from the graph that the median house price of £59,900 in 1997 has grown to £215,000 in England and Wales. By comparison, the median gross annual incomes have grown from £16,885 in 1997 to £47,574 in 2016. But for london, the house income ratio from 4 times to 11 times over the two decades.</li>
